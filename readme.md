join my leader board 982074-072aed75

feel free to copy this repo to get started. it's a pretty strait forward TDD approach

run `bundle i`
copy app/day_example.rb and create app/dayX.rb
copy spec/day1_spec.rb and create spec/dayx_spec.rb

then you can up the input and expected output in dayx_spec.rb
and you can implement the algorithms in app/dayX.rb

`rspec spec/dayX_spec.rb` will run the examples
`rspec spec/day1_spec.rb --tag solve` will solve based on your input
